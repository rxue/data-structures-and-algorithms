def merge(L1:list[int], L2:list[int]) -> list[int]:
    """
    Suppose we have two lists L1 and L2 that contain integers which are sorted in ascending order.

    Create a function merge that gets these lists as parameters and returns a new sorted list L that has all the elements of L1 and L2.

    So, len(L) should equal to len(L1)+len(L2). Do this using the fact that both lists are already sorted.

    You canâ€™t use the sorted function or the sort method in implementing the merge method. You can however use these sorted in the main function for creating inputs to the merge function.

    :param L1:
    :param L2:
    :return: sorted merged list of L1 and L2
